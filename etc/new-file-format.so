.SH NAME
How to add a new file format
.XX "" "How to add a new file format"
.SH DESCRIPTION
This section describes how to add a new file format.  It's mostly a
set of reminders for the maintainer.  If you want a format added
to the distribution, use this method and e-mail the maintainer a patch
(generated with diff -u -r, usually) and it can be added to the sources
if appropriate.
