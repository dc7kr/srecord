The <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> tools are ports of the
popular GNU development tools and utilities for Windows 95, 98, NT, XP,
Vista, <i>etc</i>.  They function by using the Cygwin library which
provides a UNIX-like API on top of the Win32 API.
<p>
This means that you can compile SRecord for Windows
95, 98, NT, XP, Vista, <i>etc</i>.  SRecord was tested
on Windows in this way.  Other tools, such as <a
href="http://www.scl.com/products/mks/datasheets/nutcracker.html">
Nutcracker</a>, are expected to work but have not been confirmed.
<p>
<a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/">DJGPP</a> is a complete 32-bit
C/C++ development system for Intel 80386 (and higher) PCs running DOS.
It includes ports of many GNU development utilities.

Once you have <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> or <a
href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/">DJGPP</a> installed, simply follow
the instructions in the BUILDING file, as if it were Unix.
<p>
<b>Note:</b>
Some problems have been reported using GCC 3.2.
If you experience problems, please try GCC 2.96 instead.
Of course, a patch to fix the 3.2 problems is always welcome.
<p>
Pre-built windows binaries are available from <a
.nf
href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=72866">
.fi
sourceforge.net</a>, although they tend to lag behind the current release.
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<img src="whining-64.png" align="right" />
<i>Please, <b>please</b>, can you just build it for me?</i>
<p>
No.  The author rarely uses Windows for anything.  No.
<p>
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/" ><img

Besides, SRecord is <a href="http://www.opensource.org/" >open source</a>.
That means you can get the <a href="srecord-\*(v).tar.gz" >source code</a>.
That means you can build it youself.
<p>
If you let the author know the URL to get your compiled binaries from,
after some-one else confirms they work, he will upload them to SourceForge.

<h2>Windows Build</h2>
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/"
><img src="http://www.cygwin.com/cygwin-icon.gif" align="right" border=0 /></a>
Building SRecord on Windows using
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" >Cygwin</a> is as easy as doing it for Unix:
<blockquote>
.nf
<pre>$ <b>./configure</b>
$ <b>make</b>
$</pre>
.fi
</blockquote>
but this makes executables which need the CYGWIN1.DLL which often isn't
what is desired.  To make executables which don't need it, do this:
<blockquote>
.nf
<pre>$ <b>CC='gcc -mno-cygwin' CXX='g++ -mno-cygwin' ./configure</b>
$ <b>make</b>
$</pre>
.fi
</blockquote>
This is how the executables on <a
.nf
href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=72866">
.fi
sourceforge.net</a> were built.
