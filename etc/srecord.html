The <i>SRecord</i> package is a collection of powerful tools for
manipulating EPROM load files.
.br
<p>
I wrote SRecord because when I was looking for programs to manipulate
EPROM load files, I could not find very many.  The ones that I could
find only did a few of the things I needed.  SRecord is written in C++
and polymorphism is used to provide the file format flexibility and
arbitrary filter chaining.  Adding more file formats and filters is
relatively simple.

SRecord runs on almost any flavor of UNIX.  The source distribution is
self configuring using a GNU Autoconf generated configure script.
It also runs on Windows NT, if you build using
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> or
<a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/">DJGPP</a>,
see the <a href="windows.html">Windows NT</a> page.

<p align=center><b>The File Formats</b></p>
<p>
The <i>SRecord</i> package understands a number of file formats:
<dl>
.br
<dt>
Ascii-Hex
<dd>
The Ascii-Hex format is understood for both reading and writing.
(Also known as the Ascii-Space-Hex format.)
.br
<dt>
ASM
<dd>
It is possible, for output only, to produce a series of DB statements
containing the data.  This can be useful for embedding data into assembler
programs.
.br
<dt>
Atmel Generic
<dd>
This format is produced by the Atmel AVR assembler.
It is understood for both reading and writing.
.br
<dt>
BASIC
<dd>
It is possible, for output only, to produce a series of DATA statements
containing the data.  This can be useful for embedding data into BASIC
programs.
.br
<dt>
Binary
<dd>
Binary files can both be read and written.
.br
<dt>
C Array
<dd>
It is possible, for output only, to produce a C array definition containing
the data.  This can be useful for embedding data into other programs.
.br
<dt>
Cosmac
<dd>
The RCA Cosmac Elf format is understood for both reading and writing.
.br
<dt>
DEC Binary
<dd>
The DEC Binary (XXDP) format is understood for both reading and writing.
.br
<dt>
Elektor Monitor (EMON52)
<dd>
The EMON52 format is understood for both reading and writing.
.br
<dt>
Fairchild Fairbug
<dd>
The Fairchild Fairbug format is understood for both reading and writing.
.br
<dt>
LSI Logic Fast Load
<dd>
The LSI Logic Fast Load format is understood for both reading and writing.
.br
<dt>
Formatted Binary
<dd>
The Formatted Binary (XXDP) format is understood for both reading and writing.
.br
<dt>
Four Packed Code (FPC)
<dd>
The FPC format is understood for both reading and writing.
.br
<dt>
Intel
<dd>
The Intel hexadecimal format is understood for both reading and writing.
(Also known as the Intel MCS-86 Object format.)
.br
<dt>
MOS Technology
<dd>
The MOS Technology hexadecimal format is understood for both reading
and writing.
.br
<dt>
Motorola S-Record
<dd>
The Motorola hexadecimal S-Record format is understood for both reading
and writing.
(Also known as the Exorciser, Exormacs or Exormax format.)
.br
<dt>
Needham Electronics
<dd>
The Needham Electronics ASCII file format is understood for both reading
and writing.
.br
<dt>
Ohio Scientific
<dd>
The Ohio Scientific hexadecimal format is understood for both reading
and writing.
.br
<dt>
Signetics
<dd>
The Signetics format is understood for both reading and writing.
.br
<dt>
Spectrum
<dd>
The Spectrum format is understood for both reading and writing.
.br
<dt>
SPASM
<dd>
The SPASM format is used by a variety of PIC programmers; it is understood
for both reading and writing.
.br
<dt>
Tektronix (Extended)
<dd>
The Tektronix hexadecimal format and the Tektronix extended hexadecimal
format are understood for both reading and writing.
.br
<dt>
Texas Instruments Tagged
<dd>
The Texas Instruments Tagged hexadecimal format is understood for both
reading and writing.
(Also known as the TI-Tagged  or TI-SDSMAC object format.)
.br
<dt>
VHDL
<dd>
It is possible, for output only, to produce a VHDL definition containing
the data.  This can be useful for some embedded development systems.
<dt>
Wilson
<dd>
The Wilson format is understood for both reading and writing.
This mystery format was added for a mysterious type of EPROM writer.
.br
<dt>
<p>
If you have a description of other EPROM load file formats that SRecord
does not yet understand, please let me know, and they can be added.

.br
<p align=center><b>The Tools</b></p>
<p>
A number of tools are include in the <i>SRecord</i> package.
All of the tools understand all of the file formats, and all of the filters.
.br
<dl><dt>
srec_cat
<dd>
The <i>srec_cat</i> program may be used to catenate (join) EPROM load
files, or portions of EPROM load files, together.  Because it understands
all of the input and output formats, it can also be used to convert
files from one format to another.
It also understands <i>filters</i>, see below.
.br
<dt>
srec_cmp
<dd>
The <i>srec_cmp</i> program may be used to compare EPROM load files,
or portions of EPROM load files, for equality.
.br
<dt>
srec_info
<dd>
The <i>srec_info</i> program may be used to print summary information
about EPROM load files.
</dl>
<p>
<br>
<p>
<br>
<p>
.br
<p align=center><b>The Filters</b></p>
<p>
The <i>SRecord</i> package is made more powerful by the concept of <i>input
filters</i>.  Wherever an input file may be specified, filters may also
be applied to that input file.  The following filters are available:
<dl><dt>
crc
<dd>
The <i>crc</i> filters may be used to insert an inustry standard cyclic
redundancy check (CRC) into the data.
.br
<dt>
crop
<dd>
The <i>crop</i> filter may be used to isolate an input address range,
or ranges, and discard the rest.
.br
<dt>
exclude
<dd>
The <i>exclude</i> filter may be used to exclude an input address range,
or ranges, and keep the rest.
.br
<dt>
fill
<dd>
The <i>fill</i> filter may be used to fill holes in the data with a
given byte value.
.br
<dt>
length
<dd>
The <i>length</i> filter may be used to insert the data length into
the data.
.br
<dt>
offset
<dd>
The <i>offset</i> filter may be used to offset the address of data records,
both forwards and backwards.
<dt>
split
<dd>
The <i>split</i> filter may be used to split EPROM images for wide data
buses or other memory striping schemes.
<dt>
unsplit
<dd>
The <i>unsplit</i> filter may be used to
reverse the effects of the <i>split</i> filter.
</dl>
.br
<p>
More than one filter may be applied to each input file.
Different filters may be applied to each input file.
All filters may be applied to all file formats.
