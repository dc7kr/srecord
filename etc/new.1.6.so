The documentation is now in PDF format.  This was in order to make it
more accessible to a wider range of people.

.if t \(bu
.\" change 16
There is a new \fIsrec_cat --address-length\fP option, so that you can set
the length of the address fields in the output file.  For example, if you
always want S3 data records in a Motorola hex file, use --address-length=4.
This helps when talking to brain-dead EPROM programmers which do not
fully implement the format specification.

.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 15
There is a new \fI--multiple\fP option to the commands, which permits
an input file to contain multiple (contradictory) values for some memory
locations.  The last value in the file will be used.

A problem has been fixed which stopped SRecord from building under Cygwin.

.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 11
A bug has been fixed in the C array output.  It used to generate invalid
output when the input had holes in the data.
