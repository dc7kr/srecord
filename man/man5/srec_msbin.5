.TH \*(n) 5 SRecord "Reference Manual"
.SH NAME
\*(n) \- Windows CE Binary Image Data Format
.XX "srec_msbin(5)" "Windows CE Binary Image Data Format"
.SH DESCRIPTION
This format is the output of the Microsoft WinCE Platform Builder.
This is a binary (non-text) file format.
File names in this format typically (ambiguously) use the \f[CW].bin\fP suffix.
.SS File Format
Data in this format start with an optional header containing the magic
\[lq]B000FF\en\[rq], followed by the image start (four bytes, little
endian) address and the span of the image (highest address - lowest
address + 1) (four bytes, little endian).
The file header does not have a checksum;
it is therefore possible that a corrupt file header will go undetected.
.PP
Then come the data itself, organized into records.  See next section.
.PP
Last comes a special record with the record address set to zero and
record length set to the image execution start address.
According to specification the record describing the execution start
address must be always present, and must always be the last record in the file.
.SS Record Format
Each record consists of a record start address (four bytes, little endian),
a record length (four bytes, little endian),
a record checksum (four bytes, little endian),
followed by the record data.
The data part of each record is raw byte values, no encoding.
.PP
The checksum is calculated by a simple sum of bytes
into a 32-bit accumulator.
.PP
The 12 record header bytes are not included in the record checksums;
it is therefore possible that a corrupt record header will go undetected.
.PP
It is not possible to place data at address zero with this format.
Address zero is reserved for use by the execution start address record.
.PP
There is effectively no limit on the length of a record (2^32-1).  It is
not uncommon for a MsBin file to contain records with sizes in the tens
of megabytes.
.SS Commentary
The MsBin files produced by SRecord are valid and can be
successfully parsed by the command line utilities \f[CW]viewbin\fP and
\f[CW]cvrtbin\fP (part of Windows CE platform).
.PP
For a MsBin file to be usable in Microsoft WinCE Platform Builder it has
to contain a TOC meta-structure.  This is data embedded in the file by
Microsoft WinCE Platform Builder itself.
.PP
The opposite conversion \- from MsBin \- comes in handy when analyzing
a MsBin file (\f[I]i.e.\fP a WinCE image).
