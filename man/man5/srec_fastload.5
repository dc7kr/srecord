.SH NAME
srec_fastload \- LSI Logic Fast Load file format
.XX "srec_fastload(5)" "LSI Logic Fast Load file format"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The FastLoad Format uses a compressed ASCII format that permits files
to be downloaded in less than half the time taken for Motorola S-records.
.PP
The base-64 encoding used is "A-Za-z0-9,.". The data is encoded in
groups of 4 characters (3 bytes, 24 bits).
.PP
The character '/' is used to introduce
a special function.
Special functions are:
.TP 8n
A\fInnnnnn\fP
Defines an address.
.TP 8n
B\fInn\fP
Define a single byte.
.TP 8n
C\fInnnn\fP
Compare the checksums.
The checksum is a simple positive 16-bit sum,
of the data bytes only.
.TP 8n
EAA
Define the program's entry point.
The address will be the current address as defined by the \fBA\fP command.
(The \fIAA\fP number in this command is ignored.)
This must be the last entry in the file.
.TP 8n
KAA
Clear the checksum.
(The \fIAA\fP number in this command is ignored.)
.TP 8n
S\fIname\fP,X
Define a symbol.
The address of the symbol will be the current address as defined by the
\fBA\fP command.
.TP 8n
Z\fInn\fP
Clear a number of bytes.
.SS Size Multiplier
In general, binary data will expand in sized by approximately 1.4 times
when represented with this format.
