Motorola's S-record format allows binary files to be uploaded and
downloaded between two computer systems.  This type of format is widely
used when transferring programs and data between a computer system (such
as a PC, Macintosh, or workstation) and an emulator or evaluation board
for Motorola microcontrollers and microprocessors.
.SS The Lines
Most S-Record file contain only S-Record lines (see the next section),
which always start with a capital S character.  Some systems generate
various ``extensions'' which usually manifest as lines which start with
something else.  These ``extension'' lines may or may not break other
systems made by other vendors.  Caveat emptor.

.SS The Fields
The S-record format consists of 5 fields. These are the type field,
length field, address field, data field, and the checksum.
The lines always start with a capital S character.

.TP 8n
Type
The type field is a 1 character field that specifies whether
the record is an S0, S1, S2, S3, S5, S7, S8 or S9 field.
.TP 8n
Record Length
The record length field is a 2 character (1 byte) field that specifies the
number of character pairs (bytes) in the record, excluding the type and
record length fields.
.TP 8n
Address
This is a 2-, 3- or 4-byte address that specifies where the data
in the S-record is to be loaded into memory.
.TP 8n
Data
The data field contains the executable code, memory-loadable data
or descriptive information to be transferred.
.TP 8n
Checksum
The checksum is an 8-bit field that represents the least significant
byte of the one's complement of the sum of the values represented
by the pairs of characters making up the record's length, address, and
data fields.

.SS Record Types
.TP 8n
S0
This type of record is the header record for each block of S-records.
The data field may contain any descriptive information identifying the
following block of S-records.  (It is commonly ``HDR'' on many systems.)
The address field is normally zero.
.TP 8n
S1
A record containing data and the 2-byte address at which the data is
to reside.
.TP 8n
S2
A record containing data and the 3-byte address at which the data is
to reside.
.TP 8n
S3
A record containing data and the 4-byte address at which the data is
to reside.
.TP 8n
S5
A record containing the number of S1, S2 and S3 records transmitted in
a particular block.  The count appears in the two-byte address field.
There is no data field.
.TP 8n
S6
A record containing the number of S1, S2 and S3 records transmitted in
a particular block.  The count appears in the three-byte address field.
There is no data field.
.TP 8n
S7
A termination record for a block of S3 records.  The address field may
contain the 4-byte address of the instruction to which control is passed.
There is no data field.
.TP 8n
S8
A termination record for a block of S2 records.  The address field may
optionally contain the 3-byte address of the instruction to which control
is passed.  There is no data field.
.TP
S9
A termination record for a block of S1 records.  The address field
may optionally contain the 2-byte address of the instruction to
which control is passed.  If not specified, the first entry point
specification encountered in the object module input will be used.
There is no data field.
.SS Size Multiplier
In general, binary data will expand in sized by approximately 2.4 times
when represented with this format.
