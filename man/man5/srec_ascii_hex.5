.\" MANIFEST: manual entry for the srec_ascii_hex.5 command
.\"
.ds n) srec_ascii_hex
.TH \*(n) 5 SRecord "Reference Manual"
.SH NAME
srec_ascii_hex \- Ascii-Hex file format
.XX "srec_ascii_hex(5)" "Ascii-Hex file format"
.SH DESCRIPTION
This format is also known as the \fIAscii-Space-Hex\fP format.
If you know who invented this format, please let me know.  If you have
a better or more complete description, I'd like to know that, too.
.PP
The file startes with a Crontrol-B character (0x02).
.LP
Each data byte is represented as 2 hexadecimal characters,
and is separated by white space from all other data bytes.
.LP
The address for data bytes is set by using a sequence of
\f[CW]$A\fP\f[CI]nnnn\fP\f[CW],\fP characters, where \fInnnn\fP is the
4-character ascii representation of the address.  The comma is required.
There is no need for an address record unless there are gaps.  Implicitly,
the file starts a address 0 if no address is set before the first
data byte.
.LP
The file ends with a Control-C character (0x03).
.SS Size Multiplier
In general, binary data will expand in sized by approximately 3.0 times
when represented with this format.
